# TacticalUrbanismProject
 Tactical Urbanism NW.js application for GS1030H

 We made a visual representation of the work being done in our servant leadership project that could be run as an application on any computer.

 For creating a 3D model we are looking to have a gltf 3D model in the site that will show what the Wellness Hub in Lindsay Height is going to look like.

 Model Design: Jessica Oratch

 Application Code: Jonathan Keane
